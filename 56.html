Veronica (Sis) Louise (1922 - 1995)<BR>
	9 July 1922, Quakers Hill<BR>
	Ray Drew(b.2.l.1923)<BR>
At	St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney<BR>
On	27 April 1943 (#7480)<BR>
Lived:	Originally "at home" at Alfred Street then later 10 Prince St, Dundas<BR>
Children:	Jeffrey, Vic, Paul, Robert, Stephen. Phillip and Joan Marie<BR>
Died: 22.5.1995	Cremated & scatted to sea off Manly<BR>
Ray died 19/5/1999	scattered at Manly<BR>
<BR>
Raymond Keith Drew (Ray) was born 2 January 1923, his parents Joe and Mabel Drew. The family lived at Parramatta.<BR>
<BR>
Sis and Ray were married in St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. Because Ray wasn't a Catholic they were married at an altar to the side of the main altar. They spent their honeymoon at Manly. The reason I know this is that when Sis was cremated her ashes were spread out to sea from Manly (where they had their honeymoon). After Ray died in 999, his ashes too were scattered to sea out from Manly.<BR>
<BR>
Sis and Ray lived at Alfred Street for a time and then moved to 10 Prince St, Dundas in 1947 where they lived until Sis's death in the 1995. In all they had 7 children. 6 boys and one girl. Their eldest is only a year or two younger than Sis's youngest brother, Kevin.<BR>
<BR>
When he was 18 he worked for Summers and Graham, soft drink factory in Dixon Street Parramatta. His father and son. Jeff also worked there.<BR>
<BR>
Ray was in the Army as "ordinance" driving trucks/transport and spent time in Darwin. Jeff mentioned that Ray met Sis through sis's brother, Allan, they both worked at Summons and Grahams. After leaving the Army Ray worked for Goodyear Tyres at Camellia, where his father worked during the war and again his son Jeff also worked. He then became a bus driver for the Harris Park Bus Company then Parramatta/Eastwood and Delwood.<BR>
<BR>
Aunty Sis worked at Newport's nursery up the road from their home in Prince Street and later worked at Coles, North Rocks as Manageress of the snackbar. Doreen and Mavis also worked there.<BR>
<BR>
When Sis was little she could not say her birth date, being 9 July. Instead she used to say 9 Uly. Now the Elliott children didn't passed up this opportunity to tease their sister and she was always reminded of her birthday being 9 Uly.<BR>
<BR>
It wasn't till I was well and truly working that I found out what Aunty Sis's real name was. I never knew her as Veronica but only as Aunty Sis. Her brothers and sisters always called her Sis and we called her Aunty Sis. It originated from Albert not being able to say her name Veronica and instead called her sis. Sis's confirmation name was Mary Therese so her name is "Veronica Louise Mary Therese".<BR>
<BR>
Joan Marie had a son shortly after Ray died in 1999 and she named him Raymond. The grandkids now affectionately call him "little pop".<BR>
