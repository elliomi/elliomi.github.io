William Chapman<BR>
<BR>
The following page outlines the account of his sentencing. William Chapman came to Australia in 1834 on the ship Susan. He received his Certificate of Freedom on 29 September 1842.<BR>
<BR>
Convicts needed permission to wed in those days but Charlotte and William eventually wed on 6 March 1843. Their marriage took place after William received his freedom but Charlotte continued to serve her time for another five years after their marriage. Charlotte is actually buried in Rookwood Cemetery and William is buried in Scotts Cemetery (wherever that is!)<BR>
<BR>
The following recounts the sentence of William Chapman <BR>
<BR>
1231. WILLIAM CHAPMAN was indicted for stealing, on the 21st of August, 1 half sovereign; 4 half-crowns: 20 shillings; and 2 sixpences, the monies of John Bodger.<BR>
<BR>
John Bodger: I lived at Mr. McGregor's, a publican at the Horse-guards - the prisoner had lived there before me, I took his situation as pot-boy there - on the 21st of August, early in the morning, I missed thirty-one shillings in silver, and a half-sovereign - I know the prisoner had been there the evening before, and he asked me to lend him 5s, which I refused to do; he bade me good night, and I saw no more of him - when I went to bed. I put my money in the right hand comer of my box, which stood in the kitchen - I locked the box, put the key into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and went to bed in the room above the kitchen-in the morning I found the key was in my left pocket-I suspected something; I went to the box, unlocked it, and missed the money' stated. 2l. 1s; 1l. Os. 6d was left - when I went to bed I put my waistcoat on a bench by the side of the door, and in the morning the coat and waistcoat had been taken from the bed and put on the other side - I told my mistress when I missed my money; and the prisoner was taken on the 23rd from the information of a soldier, who was on duty, and had seen him get in at a window which leads to one of the tap rooms, from whence he could get to the bedrooms and kitchen.<BR>
<BR>
Prisoner. Did you not tell me you had not a farthing!<BR>
<BR>
Witness: No, I said I had not a farthing to spare - the money all belonged to my master for beer.<BR>
<BR>
Court. Q. The prisoner had left y'our master's family'.<BR>
<BR>
A.	Yes, he had no business in the house at all.<BR>
<BR>
Henry Kind. I am a private in the 2nd battalion of the 1st regiment of guards. I went on guard on the night in question, at a quarter before twelve o'clock and at about half-past twelve o'clock the prisoner came to me at my box, near the prosecutor's door; he asked if the people at the public-house were gone to bed; I said I thought not as there was a light in the house - he said it was of no consequence, he could get in as they had left the window open for him - I thought he lived there, as I knew he had lived there before - he said he had got in at the window before - he opened the window, went in. and shut it down, and I saw no more of him till he was at Bow Street.<BR>
<BR>
Edmund Larkin (police-constable T 104). I took the prisoner; I found half-a-crown on him.<BR>
<BR>
Prisoner 's Defence. When I left, the prosecutor told me if I was out of place, to come and sleep there which I did for six nights - he told me of a situation which I went and got, but I returned there to sleep that night - I asked him to lend me 5s., which he said he could not, as he had not a farthing in the world - I then borrowed 6d of a young man and went away - it was impossible for me to get into the bed-room without being heard.<BR>
<BR>
John Bodger. The prisoner was not in the house in the morning, but the window shutters were open, which I had shut too when I went to bed.<BR>
<BR>
GUILTY. Age 19. Transported for Seven Years.<BR>
