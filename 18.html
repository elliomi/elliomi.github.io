While at Wentworthville Len recalls memories of his father going to work. It was during the depression and his father would leave in the middle of the night with his wheelbarrow and walk into the markets in Sydney which was about 17 miles (30 Km) from Wentworthville. He would purchase fresh fruit and vegetables and walk home via residential areas and sell what he could. Whatever was left over he would bring home for the family along with the money he earned. In all this would be a 34 mile walk in one day and then he would back up and do it again the next day. This went on for a long time.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently their father's father Joseph Elliott had written a book on the 4 gospels. That book may still be around today within the family. Madge said that he and James, her father, had the best handwriting also her brother Albert had a nice hand as well.<BR>
<BR>
When living at Granville their father worked for the Council driving a horse and dray cleaning the roads and gutters. Len remembers riding on the cart with his father while he was working and there was also a water trough at the corner of South Street opposite the Avenue at Granville. In later years dad would talk to the older locals and they would recall the trough.<BR>
<BR>
After working for the Council at Granville their father then went to work for the Hawkesbury Agricultural College at Richmond. Their father was not a well man as he suffered from bronchial asthma and eventually got laid off because he was too sick to work. He would burn cow dung and inhale the smolder to try and alleviate the coughing associated with the bronchial asthma. In later years dad suffered bronchitis and it was later suggested he too had bronchial asthma and thanks to modern medicine is being treated for it.<BR>
<BR>
Their father died in 1948 as a result of the bronchial asthma. Len remembers his father as being of a small jockey type frame.<BR>
<BR>
Even while nanna was without her husband James, nothing was ever too much for her with the 11 children as well as later with the extended family. She helped Don while his leg was mending after an accident and Val when she came down with the mumps (twice) while pregnant with Carol.<BR>
