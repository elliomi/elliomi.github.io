<BR>
Before going to War Albert worked at the Astra Theatre at Parramatta in the projection box. After entering the army he was put through special training to send morse code which became his main duty in the 8  Field Company. He was at war for about 4 years. When Mass said in the jungle (those days in Latin) Albert was about the only one who was able to answer the Mass.<BR>
<BR>
After Albert returned from War he met (through his brothers Allan and Lawrence) Val who worked at Lewisham hospital with Mavis and Marge Weiss.<BR>
<BR>
Val's mother's (Eileen Emily Allen) grandfather is Thomas Boyd. Boyd was an explorer with Hume and Hovell. Note Hume got a highway named after him. Hovell got a large monument and Boyd got a large parcel of land at Albury. Swam the Murray River. History is at Grahamstown. Val's father originally managed a dairy farm at Mount Horeb then the family moved to Grahamstown. As there was no work in the country for the girls. Val joined her sister, Pat, at Lewisham Hospital in Sydney. She was allowed to come to Sydney because they were living with the nuns. Val came to Sydney aged 15 and met Albert at about 18.<BR>
<BR>
Albert and Val went out for about 4 years and they married when Val was 22 and Albert 30. Albert and Val married at St Patrick's Parramatta on 23 June 1951 two months after the marriage of Pat and Keith. After their marriage they lived "at home" at Alfred Street where Val was well and truly introduced into the family of 11! They later settled in William Street Granville/Merrylands where they raised their family of five.<BR>
<BR>
Albert was an electrician by trade and during his working life saw many changes. Not all of them he approved of. Albert found it difficult during the times where the electrical items he installed were to replace the jobs of men earning a living for their families. The Elliott boys (and girls of course) were very clever, conscientious and good at their jobs.<BR>
<BR>
After returning from War Albert did his electrician's apprenticeship with Wright Brothers then worked for 24 years at Clyde Batteries until it closed down then worked for Warbuton Frankie on Parramatta Road, Lidcombe until he retired at age 62.<BR>
<BR>
Albert was the eldest of Dorothy and James Elliott and was named after his two grandfathers i.e. Albert Wright (his mother's father) and Joseph Elliott (his father's father).<BR>
<BR>
Albert was well known at the local Merrylands RSL Club where he was a life member and could be found in the projection/lighting box whenever the Club had shows on.<BR>
