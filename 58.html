Aunty Madge met uncle Don at a dance at Petersham Town Hall when he was in port. He was very taken with her and wanted to take her home but Aunty Madge always left the dances before the last dance for that reason. Madge used to go with her girl friend Bert and at the dance they would always get asked to dance. Madge used to go dancing 5-6 nights a week. She loved it and if she hadn't of met Don she might have danced professionally.<BR>
<BR>
Don asked if Madge would come after work for "coffee" before his ship left port. He went to the station to see her after she finished work on Friday but he didn't know that she finished work 1/2 day on Fridays. Don meanwhile after catching the cab from Tempe was in the wrong street but rather a lane by the same name and went door knocking and asking if Madge Elliott worked there.<BR>
<BR>
They met on a Wednesday night and he was leaving Friday not to return for another 5-6 weeks - he was going home to his folks in WA. He left port and a month later at another dance Madge was doing a progressive dance and ran into Kevin. Don's mate and asked after Don. Kevin said Don was standing over at the door. Kevin then went and told Don Madge was there and that's when they started going out.<BR>
<BR>
Madge described Don as well dressed and well mannered in his Grey Sateen Suit. The first night they met he asked if he could escort her home and she refused. They would walk to the station in a group. His friend Kevin said he was very taken with Madge.<BR>
<BR>
Madge did embroidery in town and also worked at home. She would often buy material and make a dress for her to wear to a dance that evening. When Madge started her own business - her mum taught her how to the accounts etc.<BR>
<BR>
Don Archer was born on 24 March 1930 at Collie, Western Australia. His parents were John Archer and Ann McGowan. Don worked on cruise ships prior to his marriage. Don worked on a couple of cruise ships including the "Kaninbua" and "Duntroon" and "Manoora" which would go from Perth, around the Pacific Islands of Fiji, Suva, Vanuatu and not to mention the famous port of Sydney where he met his future wife, Madge (alias Magdelina full of meanness!!).<BR>
<BR>
Madge and Don settled at South Granville where they brought up their 3 children and eventually ran their Embroidery business from home. Prior to that Don worked for the Waterboard and would always ride his pushbike to work but when Madge's embroidery business started thriving Don left he Waterboard and also got his license. I remember they always went on their daily walk after dinner. Madge still does but in the mornings.<BR>
