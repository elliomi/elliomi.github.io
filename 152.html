Eliza Hackett<BR>
<BR>
Eliza Hackett is the mother of Albert George "Wright", father of Dorothy Wright. Eliza Hackett was Dorothy's grandmother.<BR>
<BR>
El iza Hackett was born to Thomas and Susan Hackett. Thomas and Susan (nee Foot) came to Australia with their then young family of five on the ship "Beejapore" in 1853. Thomas was 29 and Susan 30 at the time. Their youngest child was born aboard ship on their way to Australia.<BR>
<BR>
Thomas was a farmer in England and Thomas and Susan Hackett settled in the Bega area of New South Wales. After settling in Australia Thomas and Susan had another 2 girls, Eliza being born in Australia and the youngest of their children.<BR>
<BR>
Eliza Hackett was born on 29 June 1857 at Tarragunda (or Twofold Bay) Eden.<BR>
<BR>
Thomas Hackett drowned in the Bega River on 26 July 1857, age 33. Eliza would never have known her father as she was just one month old at the time of his death.<BR>
<BR>
Susan remarried William Barrington in 1 859 and they had a further two children. How she managed with the seven children plus a newly born after the death of her husband for 1 8 months would not have been easv.<BR>
<BR>
Albert George's Birth<BR>
<BR>
When Eliza was 20 she gave birth to a son, Albert George "Hackett' at Ston\' Creek near<BR>
Bega on 14 December 1876. His birth certificate has no indication of who the father is.<BR>
His birth certificate actually states "illegitimate".<BR>
<BR>
Eliza married John Joseph "William Wright" and the family settled in Sydney. In all Elizabeth had about 9 children.<BR>
<BR>
John Joseph William Wright would be the only father Albert George had known and loved. Even though John Joseph William Wright was most likely not Albert George's natural father, he earned the title father by bringing him up. Albert George changed his name to Wright prior to his marriage. His marriage and death certificates have him down as Albert George Wright.<BR>
